# Adding images to the database

When running the pipeline, any new images listed in your configuration that do not exist in the database will be processed and uploaded to the database.
Administrators have the added option of ingesting new images via the command line, without running the full pipeline.

Administrators can refer to the [`ingestimages`](../adminusage/cli/#ingestimages) command for details on how to ingest images.
